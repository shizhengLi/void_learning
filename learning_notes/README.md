# AI Code Editor Agent Documentation

This directory contains documentation about AI code editor agent architectures, with a focus on Void's implementation and how similar functionality could be implemented using LangChain.

## Documentation Index

### 1. [Void Agent Architecture](void_agent_architecture.md)
An in-depth analysis of Void's agent architecture, explaining how it works and its key components:
- Message pipeline between UI and LLM providers
- Tool services system
- File system traversal and indexing
- Code analysis and modification
- Command execution
- Context management

### 2. [LangChain Implementation Guide](langchain_implementation_guide.md)
A practical step-by-step guide to implementing similar agent functionality using LangChain:
- Setting up the environment
- Implementing file system tools
- Implementing terminal tools
- Creating system prompts
- Building the agent
- Adding UI integration
- Safety features
- Context management

### 3. [AI Code Editors Comparison](ai_code_editors_comparison.md)
A comparison of different AI code editor agent architectures:
- Void's service-based approach
- Cursor's proprietary implementation
- GitHub Copilot's extension-based approach
- JetBrains AI's plugin-based approach
- LangChain-based standalone implementation

## Getting Started

If you're new to AI code editor agents, we recommend reading the documents in this order:
1. First read the [AI Code Editors Comparison](ai_code_editors_comparison.md) for a high-level overview
2. Then explore [Void Agent Architecture](void_agent_architecture.md) for details on how Void works
3. Finally check out the [LangChain Implementation Guide](langchain_implementation_guide.md) if you want to build your own agent
