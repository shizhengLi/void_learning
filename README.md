# Void Learning

*English | [中文](README_zh.md)*

This repository contains my learning notes and study materials for the [Void Editor](https://voideditor.com) project, focusing on AI agent implementation and architecture.

## Repository Structure

- **void/** - Git submodule of the original [Void Editor](https://github.com/voideditor/void) repository
- **learning_notes/** - My personal notes and learning materials about Void's AI agent system
- **code_agent_implementation/** - A complete LangChain-based implementation of an AI code editor agent inspired by Void's architecture

## Purpose

This repository serves as my personal learning journal while studying the Void editor's AI agent implementation. The project includes both theoretical analysis and practical implementation:

### Learning & Analysis
- System architecture research
- Agent core implementation study
- Code understanding mechanisms
- Terminal integration analysis
- Editing and change application systems
- Performance optimization strategies
- Tools system implementation

### Practical Implementation
The `code_agent_implementation/` directory contains a fully functional AI code editor agent built with LangChain, featuring:
- File system tools (search, read, edit, write)
- Terminal tools (command execution, persistent terminals)
- Context management and conversation history
- Safety features with approval system
- Multiple operation modes (standard, detailed, safe)
- Demo mode for showcasing capabilities

## Original Project

The original Void Editor project is included as a submodule. All original code belongs to the Void Editor team and is subject to their license terms.
